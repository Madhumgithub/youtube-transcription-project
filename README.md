# YouTube Video Transcription Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for converting audio from YouTube videos into text. Leveraging powerful libraries such as **MoviePy**, **Pydub**, and **SpeechRecognition**, the script extracts audio, detects silence, and transcribes speech accurately. This tool is designed for users who want to easily generate text transcriptions of video content, facilitating accessibility and content creation.

## Features

- **Audio Extraction**: Extracts audio from YouTube video files using MoviePy.
- **Silence Detection**: Identifies silence segments to improve transcription accuracy using Pydub.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribes audio into text using Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API.
- **Timestamping**: Generates transcriptions with timestamps for each segment.
- **File Export**: Saves the transcription to a text file for easy reference.

- `moviepy`
- `pydub`
- `speech_recognition`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install moviepy pydub SpeechRecognition
